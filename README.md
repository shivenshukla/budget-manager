# Budget Rocket

## Introduction

*Budget Rocket* is a Java desktop application which allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. It is a 
useful application for anyone who would like to manage their finances. This project is of interest to me because I would 
like to work for a financial institution in the future. Thus, this project is an opportunity for me to improve upon my 
skills in object-oriented software design through a financially related application. Additionally, this application is 
one I can see myself using on a daily basis to manage my own finances.
