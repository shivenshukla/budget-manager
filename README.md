## Introduction

*Budget Rocket* is a Java desktop application which allows users to keep track of their income and expenses. It is a 
useful application for anyone looking to manage their finances. This project is of interest to me because I would like 
to work for a financial institution in the future. Hence, this project provides me with the opportunity to increase my 
skills in software design in a financial environment. Additionally, this application is one I can see myself using on a 
daily basis to manage my own finances.
